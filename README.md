## Tech Stack I used

Front-end engineering becomes complex and developers are free to have their own mindset(opinionated) during the development process.

JavaScript is imperfect, but you can take advantage of thousands of libraries to get things done or build components/modules by yourself. I classify tools for different aspects of front-end development: _UI template_, _styling_, _state management_, _code optimization_, _testing_ and _editor_.

#### UI template

The reason why using UI libraries is that things will go messy if you define layout by HTML and operate on DOM elements by `document.querySelector` or jQuery.

##### React

Solving the pain of DOM operations(manipulation, accessing, property change, event handling, etc). 

JSX let you bind the component layout and functionalities together intuitionally without worry about the [Document.createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).

Behind the JSX, React handles the "real" DOMs(what users can see) rendering on pages by means of virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is a set of tree-structured JavaScript object mapping to the reall DOM.

##### [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide)

Personally, I like it more than React because it uses [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and is gonna be [W3C standard](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents)(hopefully).

Instead of JSX, I can write HTML by means of [JavaScript template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

Define CSS inside the shadow root and it will be scoped for the component only.

##### [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/)

To develop and demo UI components.

#### Styling

CSS is good enough for many cases, especially [CSS var()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) is useful for theming. The key question is how to do styling in a maintainable and scalable way.

##### [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)

For React components.

##### [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)

Use BEM whenever I have to define CSS classes.

##### [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

Basically, I avoid using SCSS in new projects. Nested selectors become unmaintainable in the end.

BEM forces me thinking about maintainabilities when designing DOM layout(which is better). But I did use SCSS in old projects.

#### State management

Having a consistent state management strategy will make your projects scalable.

##### Redux or Flux

This is more related to design choice instead of tooling. Mono state for Redux and multiple states for Flux.
Redux would be better for complicated projects.

I've ever used old fashioned two-way binding Angular 1.x and got bad performance if not carefully dealing the data flow.

#### Code optimization

Optimization here including transpiling, bundling and minimization.

##### Babel

Basically, all the bundling tools use Babel for transpiling. My basic `.babelrc` looks like this [gist](https://gist.github.com/hankchiutw/bd35cb9ef21135fb00b8cdc5d79a47c4#file-babelrc).

##### Webpack

I use it for production because there are many configurable items, tools, and plugins. 

E.g. [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer), dynamic import, code splitting, etc.

##### Rollup

Suitable for non-UI module development.

##### [Parcel](https://parceljs.org)

I use it for prototyping because it's a zero-configuration bundler.

#### Testing

Write testing, but not a strict follower of TDD.

##### Enzyme and Jest

##### mocha

#### Editor

##### Vim

See how I use Vim as an IDE: [hankchiutw/vim](https://github.com/hankchiutw/vim).

## Misc

#### From EE to software development

I was majored in EE in college and working as a hardware engineer for 4 years. When people say "how could you jump to software development?", I would say this is not a big gap when you have _Passion_.

Practically, in college, I did some parttime jobs of building web service. To build everything from scratch, I learned LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. JavaScript is boring at that time, but I was fascinated with being able to share ideas through the Internet.

At some point, [AJAX](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)>) was becoming popular. With such asynchronous technique, developing a web page became more like developing a desktop app. Hundreds of [JavaScript frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ajax_frameworks#JavaScript) popped up. Using frameworks is cool, but learning [prototype chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ajax_frameworks#JavaScript) guided me to the core of JavaScript.

My journey started from web and JavaScript and had grown up to mobile and more. Software engineering already occupied an important place in modern technologies. I'm glad I'm in.

#### Liked design patterns

- prefer composition than inheritance
- decorator pattern
- factory pattern
- singleton
